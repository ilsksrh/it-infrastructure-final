This project contains a simple shell script that determines whether
a given number is even or odd.

File description:
- main.sh (or the script file): 
  Contains a function `evenOrOdd` that checks numbers from 0 to 10
  and prints whether the number is even or odd.

How it works:
1. The script asks the user to enter a number.
2. The number is passed to the `evenOrOdd` function.
3. The function compares the number using multiple conditional checks
   and prints the result.

Usage:
Run the script in a shell:

sh main.sh

Then enter a number when prompted.
